# Jotihunt API

Welcome to the Jotihunt API documentation. This API provides access to data for the Jotihunt scouting game in the Netherlands, including team subscriptions, area statuses, and game articles.

## API Overview

The Jotihunt API follows RESTful principles and provides data in JSON format. The base URL for all API requests is:

```
https://jotihunt.nl/api/2.0
```

<Warning>The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Each client is limited to 30 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.</Warning>

The API is organized around three main resources:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Subscriptions"
    icon="users"
    href="/api-reference/subscriptions"
  >
    Access information about participating scouting groups
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Areas"
    icon="map"
    href="/api-reference/areas"

    title="Admin (not documented yet)"
    icon="lock"

    disabled
  >

  </Card>
## Authentication

The public endpoints listed in this documentation (Subscriptions, Areas, Articles) are available without authentication.

<Note>
  There are additional administrative endpoints for scouting group admins to submit assignments, hints, and other content. 
  These restricted endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens and are not documented here.
</Note>

If you are a scouting group admin needing to access these restricted endpoints, please contact the Jotihunt organization for access credentials and documentation.

## Response Format

All API responses follow a standard format:

### Single Resource Collections

Most endpoints return a collection of resources in a `data` array:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      // Resource objects
    }
  ]
}
```

### Paginated Resources

For the `/articles` endpoint, responses include pagination information:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      // Article objects
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "first": "https://jotihunt.nl/api/2.0/articles?page=1",
    "last": "https://jotihunt.nl/api/2.0/articles?page=5",
    "prev": null,
    "next": "https://jotihunt.nl/api/2.0/articles?page=2"
  },
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "from": 1,
    "last_page": 5,
    "links": [
      // Pagination links

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Each client is limited to 30 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

- `200 OK`: Request succeeded
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication
- `403 Forbidden`: Valid authentication but insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Server Error`: Unexpected server error

Error responses include additional details:

```json
{
  "error": 400,
  "message": "Invalid request parameters"
}
```
