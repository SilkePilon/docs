# Automating Jotihunt with n8n

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a powerful workflow automation platform that can help Jotihunt teams automate tasks, monitor API updates, and streamline coordination. This guide will show you how to integrate the Jotihunt API with n8n to create powerful automation workflows.

## What You Can Automate

With the Jotihunt API and n8n, you can automate:

- Real-time notifications for new articles, hints, and opdrachten (assignments)
- Automatic creation of tasks in project management tools
- Alert systems when area statuses change
- Messaging to team communication platforms (Slack, Discord, Google Chat)
- Data collection and analysis for strategic decision-making

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. An [n8n account](https://n8n.io/) (self-hosted or cloud)
2. Access to the Jotihunt API
3. Basic understanding of HTTP requests and JSON
4. Access to your team's communication tools (optional)

## Setting Up Your First n8n Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new workflow in n8n">
    1. Log in to your n8n instance
    2. Click on "Workflows" in the sidebar
    3. Click the "+ Create Workflow" button
    4. Name your workflow (e.g., "Jotihunt Article Monitor")
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a trigger node">
    You'll need a node to trigger your workflow at regular intervals. The Schedule Trigger node works well:
    
    1. Click the "+ Add node" button
    2. Search for "Schedule" and select "Schedule Trigger"
    3. Configure how often you want to check for updates:
       - For live monitoring during the event: Every 1-5 minutes
       - For testing: Every hour or manually
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect to the Jotihunt API">
    1. Add an HTTP Request node
    2. Configure it to make a GET request to the Jotihunt API:
    
    ```
    https://jotihunt.nl/api/2.0/articles
    ```
    
    3. For testing with historical data, use the Wayback Machine URL format:
    
    ```
    https://web.archive.org/web/20221010123456/https://jotihunt.nl/api/2.0/articles
    ```
    
    <Info>
      If you need test data outside of the event, refer to the [Wayback Machine section](/api-reference/jotihunt/introduction#test-data-with-wayback-machine) in our API documentation.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Processing API Responses

Once you've set up your HTTP Request node to fetch data from the Jotihunt API, you'll need to process the response.

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroup.Tab title="Articles Endpoint Example" active>
  ```javascript
  // Example of processing articles response in n8n Function node
  const articles = items[0].json.data;
  
  // Filter only new articles since last check
  // You'll need to implement your own tracking mechanism
  const newArticles = articles.filter(article => {
    // Example: Filter by publication date
    const publishDate = new Date(article.publish_at);
    const lastCheckDate = new Date(/* your last check timestamp */);
    return publishDate > lastCheckDate;
  });
  
  // Return only new articles for further processing
  return newArticles.map(article => {
    return {
      json: {
        title: article.title,
        type: article.type,
        content: article.message.content,
        publishedAt: article.publish_at,
        id: article.id
      }
    }
  });
  ```
  </CodeGroup.Tab>
  
  <CodeGroup.Tab title="Areas Endpoint Example">
  ```javascript
  // Example of processing areas response in n8n Function node
  const areas = items[0].json.data;
  
  // Check for status changes
  const statusChanges = areas.filter(area => {
    // Compare with your stored previous statuses
    const previousStatus = getPreviousStatus(area.name); // You need to implement this
    return area.status !== previousStatus;
  });
  
  // Return areas with status changes
  return statusChanges.map(area => {
    return {
      json: {
        name: area.name,
        status: area.status,
        previousStatus: getPreviousStatus(area.name),
        changedAt: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    }
  });
  ```
  </CodeGroup.Tab>
</CodeGroup>

## Advanced Workflow: AI-Powered Analysis

You can enhance your Jotihunt workflow with AI to automatically analyze new hints and assignments. Here's how to set up an advanced workflow that:

1. Fetches new articles from the API
2. Uses AI to analyze content and determine actions
3. Creates tasks in ClickUp
4. Sends notifications to Google Chat

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up the basic workflow">
    Follow the steps above to create a workflow that fetches articles from the Jotihunt API.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add an AI node">
    1. Add an AI Agent node (requires n8n's LangChain integration)
    2. Connect it to your HTTP Request node
    3. Create a system prompt that helps the AI understand how to process Jotihunt content
    
    <Warning>
      Make sure your system prompt includes context about Jotihunt, what kinds of content to expect, and how to categorize articles (hints, assignments, news).
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure integration tools">
    Add nodes for your team's tools:
    
    1. ClickUp (or other task management system)
    2. Google Chat, Slack, or Discord for notifications
    3. Google Sheets or a database for tracking data
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Workflow: Jotihunt 2025 Automation

Here's an example of a complete workflow for automating Jotihunt 2025:

```javascript
// Sample workflow structure (simplified)
{
  "name": "JotiHunt 2025",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {
        "rule": {
          "interval": []
        }
      },
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.scheduleTrigger",
      "name": "Schedule Trigger"
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "url": "https://jotihunt.nl/api/2.0/articles",
        "options": {}
      },
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest",
      "name": "HTTP Request"
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "promptType": "define",
        "text": "=New {{ $json.data[0].type }}\n\nTitle: {{ $json.data[0].title }}\nPublish at: {{ $json.data[0].publish_at }}\nContent: {{ $json.data[0].message.content }}"
      },
      "type": "@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent",
      "name": "AI Agent"
    },
    // Other nodes for task creation and notifications
  ]
}
```

This workflow:
1. Checks for new articles every few minutes
2. Processes the articles and identifies their type (hint, assignment, news)
3. Uses AI to analyze the content and extract key information
4. Creates appropriate tasks in ClickUp with all necessary details
5. Sends formatted notifications to Google Chat with actionable information

### Workflow Configuration Details

The core components of this workflow are:

1. **Schedule Trigger**: Runs every 5 minutes during the event
2. **HTTP Request**: Fetches the latest articles from `https://jotihunt.nl/api/2.0/articles`
3. **AI Agent**: Processes the content with a comprehensive system prompt

### AI System Prompt Example

This is an example of an AI system prompt that can effectively process Jotihunt content:

```
You are an advanced Jotihunt Intelligence Assistant designed to analyze and process incoming assignments (opdrachten), hints, and news updates for the Jotihunt live game.

## ABOUT JOTIHUNT:
Jotihunt is an annual interactive fox hunt for Dutch scouting groups in Gelderland, organized by volunteers. Teams ("hunters") track fox teams moving throughout Gelderland. Fox locations are revealed through cryptic hints on the game website.

## YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:
When receiving new information, you will categorize it as one of three types:
- HINT: Clues about fox team locations that need deciphering
- OPDRACHT (ASSIGNMENT): Tasks the team must complete to earn points
- NEWS: General game updates, rule changes, announcements, or other information

For each type, you will:
1. ANALYZE THE CONTENT
2. SEND DETAILED MESSAGE
3. CREATE TASK (for hints and assignments only)
```

### Task Creation Logic

For each article type, you'll want different task parameters:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroup.Tab title="Hint Tasks" active>
  ```javascript
  // Example task creation for hints
  if (itemType === 'hint') {
    // Create in the Hints list
    return {
      name: `Hint: ${article.title}`,
      content: formatHintContent(article),
      priority: determineUrgency(article),
      timeEstimate: estimateDifficulty(article) * 3600, // in seconds
      // other parameters...
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeGroup.Tab>
  
  <CodeGroup.Tab title="Assignment Tasks">
  ```javascript
  // Example task creation for assignments
  if (itemType === 'opdracht') {
    // Create in the Assignments list
    return {
      name: `Opdracht: ${article.title}`,
      content: formatAssignmentContent(article),
      priority: determineDueDate(article) ? 1 : 2, // higher priority if due soon
      dueDateTime: extractDueDate(article),
      timeEstimate: estimateCompletionTime(article) * 3600, // in seconds
      // other parameters...
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeGroup.Tab>
</CodeGroup>

## Google Chat Integration

To send notifications to your team's Google Chat space, add a Google Chat node:

```javascript
{
  "parameters": {
    "spaceId": "=JotiHunt 2025",
    "messageUi": {
      "text": "{{ $json.formattedMessage }}"
    }
  },
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.googleChatTool"
}
```

Your AI processing node should format messages differently based on content type:

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroup.Tab title="Hint Notification Format" active>
  ```
  üîç **NEW HINT: [Title]**
  
  **Summary:** [Brief overview of the hint]
  
  **Details:** [Full hint content]
  
  **Initial Analysis:**
  - [Key observation 1]
  - [Key observation 2]
  - [Key observation 3]
  
  **Suggested Approach:**
  1. [Step 1]
  2. [Step 2]
  3. [Step 3]
  
  **ClickUp Task:** [Link to created task]
  ```
  </CodeGroup.Tab>
  
  <CodeGroup.Tab title="Assignment Notification Format">
  ```
  üìù **NEW ASSIGNMENT: [Title]**
  
  **Deadline:** [Extracted deadline]
  
  **Requirements:**
  - [Requirement 1]
  - [Requirement 2]
  - [Requirement 3]
  
  **Resources Needed:**
  - [Resource 1]
  - [Resource 2]
  
  **Difficulty Level:** [Easy/Medium/Hard]
  
  **ClickUp Task:** [Link to created task]
  ```
  </CodeGroup.Tab>
</CodeGroup>

## Testing Your Workflow

Before the actual Jotihunt event, you should test your workflow thoroughly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use test data">
    Set up your workflow with historical data using the Wayback Machine API.
    See the [Test Data with Wayback Machine](/api-reference/jotihunt/introduction#test-data-with-wayback-machine) section of our documentation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test each node individually">
    Execute each node separately to make sure it's processing data correctly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Simulate a full event cycle">
    Run a simulation of the entire event by feeding historical data through your workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Add error handling nodes to prevent workflow failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect the Jotihunt API rate limit (30 requests per minute)
- **Data Storage**: Store processed data to avoid duplicate processing
- **Notifications**: Set up critical error notifications for your team
- **Manual Override**: Include options for manual intervention and correction
- **Testing**: Test thoroughly with historical data before the live event
